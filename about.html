                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my photography portfolio. I'm a passionate photographer who loves capturing the beauty
                    of the world through my lens. My work focuses on landscape and nature photography, with a particular
                    interest in golden hour shots and dramatic lighting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've been photographing for over 10 years, and my work has been featured in various publications
                    and exhibitions. I believe that photography is not just about capturing moments, but about telling
                    stories and evoking emotions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My photography journey has taken me to stunning locations around the world, from the rugged
                    coastlines
                    of California to the majestic peaks of the Swiss Alps. Each location presents unique challenges and
                    opportunities to capture something truly special.
